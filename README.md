## Harmonious Exalted character management for a new age

Lot-Casting Atemi is a character manager for Exalted Third Edition, a tabletop role-playing game by White Wolf and Onyx Path. It is a passion project by [/u/hushnowquietnow](https://reddit.com/u/hushnowquietnow).

Keep track of your characters' attributes, abilities, charms, merits, and more all from one place, accessible from any device with an Internet connection. PC screens, phones, and tablets are all supported, and character sheets are synced in real-time across all devices.

Solar and Dragon-Blooded Exalts, as well as mortal characters, are fully supported. Custom and homebrew exalts are also available. A robust excellency builder allows for any dice cap published in an official supplement, and many that aren't.

Quick Characters are fully supported, and have their own merits, charms, intimacies, and dice pools.

Battlegroups have size, might, and drill bonuses automatically calculated. There are easy shortcuts to create Battlegroups from any existing QC.
