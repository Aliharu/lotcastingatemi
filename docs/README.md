#### DB Excellency caps

The DBs book says the dice cap for static values is rounded up, but [according to Vance, this is a typo](http://forum.theonyxpath.com/forum/main-category/exalted/1069023-ask-the-devs?p=1275486#post1275486). LCA rounds the cap down for standard DB characters, but custom exalts have a 'roundup' option in their excellency builder.

#### Invulnerable Skin of Bronze

The soak bonus granted by having ISoB as a control spell [applies even when the character is wearing armor](http://forum.theonyxpath.com/forum/main-category/exalted/1069023-ask-the-devs?p=1187120#post1187120). LCA applies this bonus unconditionally for characters with ISoB as a control spell.
